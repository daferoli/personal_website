                Hello, my name is Dave and I'd like to welcome you to my website. This is the place that I intend to keep my collection of neat things.
                I've decided that if I have a place to show off my skills, I'll be more excited and commited to my own work. Clearly I'm starting with
                this site, but I hope to grow out with more projects to improve my skills and build my portfolio. There's always more room in this
                world for ideas, so I need to try out some of mine and maybe one day, one of them won't be terrible, and you'll find that here! 
                In the mean time I hope you decide to stay and hang out with me on my journey to be a little more awesome every day, and that you're 
                inspired to do the same.
            </p>
