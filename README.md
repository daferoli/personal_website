##David's Homepage

This will be my hopepage that I intend to use as a portal to showcase my skills as a developer.

Nothing fancy here, just have this uploaded as a backup location for the codebase.

Currently I am hoting this on 1mb.site, as a simple way to host this simple site. 
This project uses Bootstrap to help with the design. I originally attempted my own CSS and design, but this proved
to save enough time and effort that I could put elsewhere to be more worth it.

If you find some inspiration here for your own site, that's awesome! I hope myself that this will
inspire me to continue working on my side projects so that this place doesn't sit empty.
